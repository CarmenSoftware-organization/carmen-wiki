# Dashboard

> **At a Glance**
> **Route:** `/dashboard` (server-redirects to `/dashboard/main`) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **For:** All operator roles post-login &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Status:** **Mock-data today**; live hooks defined but not mounted

## 1. What & Who

The Dashboard module is the first screen most operators see after login. A sidebar group exposes six sibling pages — one per operational domain — each a read-only collage of tiles, tables, and charts that answers *"what needs my attention today?"* without opening the underlying transactional module.

Two design notes that matter to developers and testers:

- All six pages are **mock-data-driven** today via `app/(root)/dashboard/mock/*.ts`. Live count hooks (`useMyPendingPrCount`, `useMyPendingPoCount`, `useMyPendingSrCount`, `useApprovalPending`) exist but are **not yet mounted**.
- Tile colour stripes resolve via longest-prefix match in `constant/module-color-map.ts` (`--sub-pr`, `--sub-po`, `--sub-grn`, `--sub-store-requisition`, `--module-inventory`).

**Audience**

| Persona | Lands on | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Requestor | [dashboard/sr](/en/inventory/dashboard/sr), [dashboard/pr](/en/inventory/dashboard/pr) | Own pending requisitions and sent-back items |
| Approver (HOD, Procurement Manager) | [dashboard/pr](/en/inventory/dashboard/pr), [dashboard/po](/en/inventory/dashboard/po) | Approval queue + bottleneck pipeline |
| Purchaser | [dashboard/po](/en/inventory/dashboard/po) | Open POs, overdue deliveries, vendor performance |
| Receiver | [dashboard/grn](/en/inventory/dashboard/grn) | Pending POs to receive today/week, partial receipts |
| Inventory Controller / Store Manager | [dashboard/inventory](/en/inventory/dashboard/inventory) | Slow-moving stock, replenishment, PST status |
| Executive | [dashboard/main](/en/inventory/dashboard/main) | Cross-domain spend, budget utilisation, top vendors |

## 2. Pages in This Module

- [dashboard/main](/en/inventory/dashboard/main) — landing dashboard with cross-module KPIs (spend, pending PRs, open POs, budget)
- [dashboard/pr](/en/inventory/dashboard/pr) — Purchase Request pipeline, sent-back/rejected, approval queue
- [dashboard/po](/en/inventory/dashboard/po) — Purchase Order pipeline, overdue deliveries, on-time / completeness gauges
- [dashboard/grn](/en/inventory/dashboard/grn) — Goods Receive Note KPIs, pending PO by day-band, incomplete/over-received GRNs
- [dashboard/inventory](/en/inventory/dashboard/inventory) — stock pipeline, slow-moving, replenishment, PST status, expired items
- [dashboard/sr](/en/inventory/dashboard/sr) — Store Requisition pipeline, sent-back, awaiting approval, consumption charts

## 3. Data Sources (Dev)

When live wiring is enabled, each tile resolves to one of three backend surfaces:

- **My-pending counts** — `GET /api/proxy/api/my-pending/{purchase-requests,purchase-orders,store-requisitions}/count` (see `constant/api-endpoints.ts`). Returns `{ pending: number }` per doc type.
- **Approval queue** — `GET /api/proxy/api/approval/pending` and `/summary`. Returns `ApprovalItem[]` grouped by `doc_type` (`pr` / `po` / `sr`) with `workflow_current_stage`, `doc_date`, `total_amount`.
- **Per-domain aggregates** — pipeline / KPI numbers (currently mock) will eventually resolve to query-dataset reports from [reporting-audit](/en/inventory/reporting-audit), not per-row scans of transactional tables.

See each sub-page for tile-to-endpoint mapping.
