## 1. Overview

The Users module is backed by four tables. `tb_user` is the identity anchor: one row per person, holding the fields required for sign-in (`username`, `email`), the `platform_role` enum that every other module's `allowedRoles` array reads, and the `is_active` / `is_consent` flags that gate access. Name parts (`firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname`) and supplementary contact fields live in the companion table `tb_user_profile`, which has a 1:M relation to `tb_user` via `user_id` — the Prisma relation is 1:M at the schema level, but the application treats it as a 1:1 extension of `tb_user` — see §2.4 for the constraint detail.

The two many-to-many join tables extend the user into organisational scope. `tb_cluster_user` records which clusters a user belongs to and at what per-cluster role (`admin` or `user`); this table is authoritatively mutated from the cluster edit page, not from the Users module. `tb_user_tb_business_unit` records which business units a user is assigned to within those clusters, carrying its own per-BU role and an `is_default` flag that marks the BU the inventory application should land on at login; this table is mutated from the Add BU dialog on the user edit screen.

All four tables carry the full audit trio — `created_at`/`created_by_id`, `updated_at`/`updated_by_id`, `deleted_at`/`deleted_by_id` — enabling soft-delete and full audit trails. The `deleted_at`-based unique constraints on all join tables mean a user-cluster or user-BU relationship can be logically deleted and then re-created without a unique-key collision.

## 2. Entities

### 2.1 `tb_user`

The identity row. One row per platform user, driving sign-in and carrying the `platform_role` value that every other module's `allowedRoles` array tests. This table does not store a password hash directly — credential management is delegated to Keycloak; the `fetchKeycloakUsers` API call synchronises user records from Keycloak into this table. Online-presence fields (`socket_id`, `is_online`) track real-time WebSocket state.

| Field | Prisma Type | Nullable | Default | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | `String @db.Uuid` | No | `gen_random_uuid()` | Primary key, UUID v4 |
| `username` | `String @db.VarChar` | No | — | Sign-in handle; unique (with `deleted_at`); set once at create and disabled in the edit form |
| `email` | `String @db.VarChar` | No | — | Email address; indexed |
| `alias_name` | `String? @db.VarChar` | Yes | — | Display alias, shown in place of full name when set |
| `platform_role` | `enum_platform_role` | No | `user` | Single role value that drives every `allowedRoles` gate across the Platform SPA and downstream applications |
| `is_active` | `Boolean?` | Yes | `false` | When `false`, sign-in is blocked regardless of Keycloak state |
| `is_consent` | `Boolean?` | Yes | `false` | Tracks whether the user has accepted the terms/consent flow |
| `consent_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | — | Timestamp of consent acceptance |
| `socket_id` | `String?` | Yes | — | WebSocket socket identifier for the current session, if any |
| `is_online` | `Boolean` | No | `false` | Real-time presence flag updated by the WebSocket layer |
| `created_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: row creation time |
| `created_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the creator |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: last update time |
| `updated_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the last updater |
| `deleted_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | — | Soft-delete timestamp; NULL = live row |
| `deleted_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the deleter |

**Constraints:**
- `@id` on `id`
- `@@unique([username, deleted_at])` — map `"user_username_deleted_at_u"` — allows username re-use after soft delete
- FK: `created_by_id` → `tb_user.id` (NoAction / NoAction)
- FK: `updated_by_id` → `tb_user.id` (NoAction / NoAction)

**Indexes:**
- `@@index([email])` — map `"user_email_idx"`
- `@@index([username])` — map `"user_username_idx"`

### 2.2 `tb_cluster_user`

Many-to-many join between `tb_user` and `tb_cluster`. Each row records that a specific user belongs to a specific cluster, at what role, and whether that membership is currently active. This table is the authoritative source for cluster membership; the Users module shows these rows read-only in the Clusters card. The `parent_bu_id` field (nullable) identifies the billing-owner BU for the user within that cluster.

| Field | Prisma Type | Nullable | Default | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | `String @db.Uuid` | No | `gen_random_uuid()` | Primary key |
| `user_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | FK to `tb_user.id` |
| `cluster_id` | `String @db.Uuid` | No | — | FK to `tb_cluster.id` |
| `is_active` | `Boolean?` | Yes | `true` | Membership active flag |
| `parent_bu_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Billing-owner BU for this user-cluster relationship |
| `role` | `enum_cluster_user_role` | No | `user` | Per-cluster role: `admin` or `user` |
| `created_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: row creation time |
| `created_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the creator |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: last update time |
| `updated_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the last updater |
| `deleted_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | — | Soft-delete timestamp; NULL = live row |
| `deleted_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the deleter |

**Constraints:**
- `@id` on `id`
- FK: `cluster_id` → `tb_cluster.id` (NoAction / NoAction)
- FK: `user_id` → `tb_user.id` (NoAction / NoAction)

**Indexes:**
- `@@unique([user_id, cluster_id, deleted_at])` — map `"user_cluster_deleted_at_u"` — allows re-assignment after soft delete

### 2.3 `tb_user_tb_business_unit`

Many-to-many join between `tb_user` and `tb_business_unit`. Each row records that a specific user is assigned to a specific business unit, at what role, whether that assignment is active, and whether it is the user's default BU (the one the inventory application lands on at login). This table is mutated from the Add BU dialog on the user edit screen; the `business_unit` module's Users card reads the same rows.

| Field | Prisma Type | Nullable | Default | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | `String @db.Uuid` | No | `gen_random_uuid()` | Primary key |
| `user_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | FK to `tb_user.id` |
| `business_unit_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | FK to `tb_business_unit.id` |
| `role` | `enum_user_business_unit_role` | No | `user` | Per-BU role: `admin` or `user`; orthogonal to `platform_role` |
| `is_default` | `Boolean?` | Yes | `false` | Marks the BU the inventory app lands on at login |
| `is_active` | `Boolean?` | Yes | `true` | Assignment active flag |
| `created_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: row creation time |
| `created_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the creator |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: last update time |
| `updated_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the last updater |
| `deleted_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | — | Soft-delete timestamp; NULL = live row |
| `deleted_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the deleter |

**Constraints:**
- `@id` on `id`
- FK: `business_unit_id` → `tb_business_unit.id` (NoAction / NoAction)
- FK: `user_id` → `tb_user.id` (NoAction / NoAction)

**Indexes:**
- `@@unique([user_id, business_unit_id, deleted_at])` — map `"user_businessunit_user_business_unit_deleted_at_u"` — allows re-assignment after soft delete

### 2.4 `tb_user_profile`

Profile extension for `tb_user`. Holds the name parts and supplementary contact fields that the SPA surfaces in the User Details form as editable fields. The Prisma relation is 1:M (`user_id` is nullable with no UNIQUE constraint at the Prisma level), but the application treats it as a 1:1 extension, creating or updating exactly one profile row per user.

| Field | Prisma Type | Nullable | Default | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | `String @db.Uuid` | No | `gen_random_uuid()` | Primary key |
| `user_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | FK to `tb_user.id` |
| `firstname` | `String @db.VarChar(100)` | No | `""` | Given name |
| `middlename` | `String? @db.VarChar(100)` | Yes | `""` | Middle name |
| `lastname` | `String? @db.VarChar(100)` | Yes | `""` | Family name |
| `telephone` | `String? @db.VarChar(20)` | Yes | — | Contact telephone number |
| `bio` | `Json? @db.Json` | Yes | `{}` | Free-form biography/notes as JSON |
| `avatar_file_token` | `String? @db.VarChar` | Yes | — | Reference to the user's avatar image in the platform file service. Resolves to a CDN/S3 URL via the application layer (same `file_token` pattern as `tb_business_unit.logo_file_token` and `tb_product_image.file_token`). Added 2026-05-20. |
| `created_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: row creation time |
| `created_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the creator |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | `now()` | Audit: last update time |
| `updated_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the last updater |
| `deleted_at` | `DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(6)` | Yes | — | Soft-delete timestamp; NULL = live row |
| `deleted_by_id` | `String? @db.Uuid` | Yes | — | Audit: FK to `tb_user.id` of the deleter |

**Constraints:**
- `@id` on `id`
- FK: `user_id` → `tb_user.id` (NoAction / NoAction)

**Indexes:**
- `@@index([firstname, lastname])` — map `"userprofile_firstname_lastname_idx"`
- `@@index([user_id])` — map `"userprofile_user_idx"`

## 3. Relationships

```
tb_user  1 ─── M  tb_cluster_user  M ─── 1  tb_cluster
tb_user  1 ─── M  tb_user_tb_business_unit  M ─── 1  tb_business_unit
tb_user  1 ─── M  tb_user_profile
tb_user  self-FK  created_by_id, updated_by_id  (audit relations)
```

Key FK directions (all `onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction`):

- `tb_cluster_user.user_id` → `tb_user.id`
- `tb_cluster_user.cluster_id` → `tb_cluster.id`
- `tb_user_tb_business_unit.user_id` → `tb_user.id`
- `tb_user_tb_business_unit.business_unit_id` → `tb_business_unit.id`
- `tb_user_profile.user_id` → `tb_user.id`

Note: `tb_user_tb_business_unit` does **not** carry a `cluster_id` column in the Prisma schema. The scoping of available BUs to the user's existing clusters is enforced at the application layer (the Add BU dialog queries BUs filtered by the user's current cluster memberships), not as a FK constraint at the database level.

## 4. Enums

### `enum_platform_role` — 7 values

The single field on `tb_user` that drives every `allowedRoles` gate across the Platform SPA. Assigned at user creation; changing it takes effect at the user's next sign-in.

| Value | Meaning | Can sign in to Platform SPA |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `super_admin` | Highest-privilege role in the Prisma enum; passes `ALLOWED_ROLES` authentication but is **not** listed in any route-level `allowedRoles` array in `App.tsx` — effective access matches the open-access route set (Dashboard, Business Units, Users, Profile). See [auth-roles](/en/platform/auth-roles) for the full per-role route matrix. | Yes |
| `platform_admin` | Platform-level administrator; same operational reach as super_admin in the SPA | Yes |
| `support_manager` | Carmen support engineer with management authority; can access clusters and report templates | Yes |
| `support_staff` | Carmen support engineer; read/edit access to operational modules | Yes |
| `security_officer` | Security-focused role; can authenticate against the Platform admin SPA but holds no additional route-level privileges beyond the open-access routes (business-units, users, profile). See [auth-roles](/en/platform/auth-roles) for the complete route matrix. | Yes |
| `integration_developer` | Technical integration account; valid in Prisma data but **not** in `ALLOWED_ROLES` — holder cannot sign in to the Platform admin SPA | No |
| `user` | Default role for new accounts; valid in Prisma data but **not** in `ALLOWED_ROLES` — holder cannot sign in to the Platform admin SPA | No |

The five sign-in-permitted values are defined in `AuthContext.ALLOWED_ROLES` in `../carmen-platform/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`. A user row carrying `integration_developer` or `user` is legitimate data (e.g. a customer-side user synced from Keycloak) but their holders will see an access-denied screen when they attempt to authenticate against the Platform admin SPA.

### `enum_cluster_user_role` — 2 values

Carried on `tb_cluster_user.role`. Controls what the user can do within a specific cluster. Independent from `platform_role` — a `support_staff` platform user could have cluster `admin` rights on one cluster and cluster `user` rights on another.

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `admin` | Cluster-level administrator; can manage the cluster's BUs and user roster |
| `user` | Standard cluster member; read and operational access within the cluster |

### `enum_user_business_unit_role` — 2 values

Carried on `tb_user_tb_business_unit.role`. Controls what the user can do within a specific business unit. Independent from both `platform_role` and `enum_cluster_user_role`.

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `admin` | BU-level administrator; can manage the BU's settings and inventory operations |
| `user` | Standard BU member; operational access to the BU's inventory workflows |

## 5. Divergences from carmen-platform SPA shape

The `UserFormData` interface in `UserEdit.tsx` (lines 67–75) declares 8 editable fields: `username`, `email`, `platform_role`, `alias_name`, `firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname`, `is_active`.

The Prisma-level divergence is that `firstname`, `middlename`, and `lastname` do **not** live in `tb_user`. They live in `tb_user_profile`. The SPA flattens both tables into a single `UserFormData` object and splits writes between `tb_user` (core fields) and `tb_user_profile` (name fields) transparently. The `UserEdit.tsx` load function confirms this: it merges `profile.firstname || user.firstname` when populating the form, reflecting that some older records may have had name fields on the user row before the profile extension table was introduced.

The `User` interface in `src/types/index.ts` also carries `firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname` directly (not nested under a `user_profile` key), which is the flattened API response shape rather than the Prisma storage shape.

The load function additionally reads `profile.alias_name || user.alias_name`; since `alias_name` has never lived on `tb_user_profile`, the profile leg always resolves to undefined and `user.alias_name` is the effective value — a defensive fallback the SPA carries but does not depend on.

No other divergences detected as of 2026-05-19.

| SPA field | SPA source | Prisma table | Notes |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----- |
| `username` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user.username` | Aligned |
| `email` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user.email` | Aligned |
| `platform_role` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user.platform_role` | Aligned |
| `alias_name` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user.alias_name` | Loaded via `profile.alias_name \|\| user.alias_name`; profile leg is always undefined — effectively aligned. |
| `is_active` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user.is_active` | Aligned |
| `firstname` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user_profile.firstname` | SPA flattens profile into user form |
| `middlename` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user_profile.middlename` | SPA flattens profile into user form |
| `lastname` | `UserFormData` | `tb_user_profile.lastname` | SPA flattens profile into user form |
