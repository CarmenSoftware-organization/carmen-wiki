# Platform RBAC — Permissions

> **At a Glance**
> **Gate:** every guarded route carries `requiredPermission="resource.action"` (or `requireSuperAdmin`) on `PrivateRoute` &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Resolution order:** bootstrap → super-admin → platform keys → cluster keys &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Bootstrap exception:** total user count 0 or 1 ⇒ login skips the ≥1-permission gate and `hasPermission` returns `true` &nbsp;·&nbsp; **On failure:** `<AccessDenied>` inside `<Layout>` (sidebar stays visible) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **In-page gates:** `<Can>` wraps Add/Edit/Delete on most management list and edit pages (`.create`/`.update`/`.delete` keys, cluster-scoped for Clusters/Business Units); within the RBAC module's own screens only the User Platform detail page uses it (`user_platform.manage`)

## 1. Overview

This page is the canonical map of how permission keys gate the Platform SPA. Authorization happens at three layers that share one resolver: the **route guard** (`PrivateRoute`'s `requiredPermission` / `requireSuperAdmin` props), the **sidebar filter** (`Layout.tsx` hides nav items whose `permission` the session lacks), and **in-page gates** (`<Can permission="...">` wrapping individual buttons and forms). All three call `AuthContext.hasPermission`, which delegates to the pure `checkPermission` function over the session's `EffectivePermissions` snapshot.

Two routes are authenticated-only with no key requirement: `/dashboard` and `/profile`. Any session that passes login reaches them. Everything else carries a key — and because the login gate itself requires the account to hold at least one permission (or the super-admin flag, or the bootstrap exception), a session cannot be admitted with zero permissions at login time outside bootstrap. The ≥1-permission gate runs only inside `login()`, though: a session whose grants are revoked mid-session stays signed in even after the snapshot refetch — it just fails every subsequent permission check.

## 2. Gate matrix

### 2.1 RBAC module screens

| Route | Component | Guard | In-page gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/platform/roles` | `RoleManagement` | `role.read` | None — Add/Edit/Delete/Export visible to every holder of `role.read` |
| `/platform/roles/new` | `RoleEdit` | `role.create` | None |
| `/platform/roles/:id/edit` | `RoleEdit` | `role.update` | None |
| `/platform/permissions` | `PermissionCatalog` | `role.read` | None (read-only screen) |
| `/platform/super-admins` | `SuperAdminManagement` | `requireSuperAdmin` | None |
| `/platform/user-platform` | `UserPlatformManagement` | `user_platform.read` | None |
| `/platform/user-platform/:userId` | `UserPlatformEdit` | `user_platform.read` | `<Can permission="user_platform.manage">` on Add Role, the add-role form, and per-row Remove |

Note that the Roles list's **Delete** action is not separately gated — `role.read` suffices to see and click it, unlike the other management lists, which wrap Delete in `<Can permission="*.delete">` (§3). Whether the role delete succeeds is up to the backend's enforcement of `role.delete` (see §5).

### 2.2 Rest of the SPA

| Route prefix | Guard (list / new / edit) | Gotcha |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard`, `/profile` | authenticated only — no key | |
| `/clusters` | `cluster.read` / `cluster.create` / `cluster.update` | |
| `/business-units` | `cluster.read` / `cluster.create` / `cluster.update` | **Reuses `cluster.*` keys** — there are no `business_unit.*` keys; granting cluster access also grants Business Units, and the two cannot be separated |
| `/users` | `user.read` / `user.create` / `user.update` | Distinct from `user_platform.*`, which gates role assignment, not user CRUD |
| `/applications` | `application.read` / `application.create` / `application.update` | |
| `/report-templates` | `report_template.read` / `report_template.create` / `report_template.update` | |
| `/print-template-mapping` | `print_template_mapping.read` / `print_template_mapping.create` / `print_template_mapping.update` | |
| `/news` | `news.read` / `news.create` / `news.update` | |
| `/broadcasts/new` | `broadcast.send` | Single route; no list page |

Three routes are fully public (no `PrivateRoute` at all): `/` (landing), `/login`, and `/changelog`. Source: `../carmen-platform/src/App.tsx` (the full `<Routes>` block, lines 48–301). No route anywhere in the SPA passes a `.delete` key as `requiredPermission` — delete actions live inside list pages, where every management list except Roles gates them in-page with `<Can permission="*.delete">` (§3). Only the Roles list still exposes Delete to anyone holding its `.read` guard (§2.1).

## 3. How guards compose

A user's path to any action passes up to three gates, outermost first:

1. **Route guard** — `PrivateRoute` (`src/components/PrivateRoute.tsx`). If the session is unauthenticated it renders `<Navigate to="/login" replace />`. If `requiredPermission` is set and `hasPermission(requiredPermission)` is false — or `requireSuperAdmin` is set and `isSuperAdmin` is false — it renders `<AccessDenied />`, a card inside the normal `<Layout>` shell (shield icon, "Access Denied", "You don't have permission to access this page.", a Back-to-Dashboard button). The sidebar stays visible and the session stays valid.
2. **Sidebar filter** — `Layout.tsx` declares `allNavItems` where each entry may carry `permission: '<key>'` or `superAdminOnly: true`, then filters: an item survives only when `(!item.permission || hasPermission(item.permission)) && (!item.superAdminOnly || isSuperAdmin)`. Hidden items are still directly addressable by URL — the route guard is the real barrier; the sidebar is UX. The sidebar keys match the route keys one-for-one for the list routes (`role.read`, `user_platform.read`, `cluster.read`, etc.), so there is no divergence where a visible entry leads to `AccessDenied`. The Permission Catalog has no sidebar entry at all.
3. **In-page gate** — `<Can permission="..." clusterId?>` (`src/components/Can.tsx`) renders its children only when `hasPermission` passes, with an optional `fallback` (default: nothing). `<Can>` gates Add/Edit/Delete across most of the SPA's management pages: the list pages (Clusters, Business Units, Users, Applications, Report Templates, Print Template Mapping, News) wrap their Add button in the `.create` key, row Edit in `.update`, and row Delete in `.delete`; the corresponding edit pages wrap their save/toggle/delete actions in `.update`; and BroadcastCompose wraps Send in `broadcast.send`. The Clusters and Business Units gates pass a `clusterId` (e.g. `<Can permission="cluster.update" clusterId={row.original.id}>`), taking the cluster-specific resolution branch (§4) — the only call sites that do. Within the RBAC module's own screens, only the User Platform detail page uses `<Can>` (`user_platform.manage` on Add Role, the add-role form, and per-row Remove); the Roles list, Role editor, Permission Catalog, Super Admins, and User Platform list expose all of their actions to anyone who passes the route guard.

All three layers call the same `hasPermission(key, opts?)` from `AuthContext` — there is exactly one resolution algorithm (§4), so route, sidebar, and in-page outcomes can never disagree for the same key. Note that route guards never pass a `clusterId`, so they take the broad "any cluster grants it" branch: a role scoped to a single cluster still opens the corresponding screens platform-wide in the current SPA, and the cluster-scoped narrowing matters for `<Can clusterId>` call sites and backend enforcement.

## 4. Permission resolution walkthrough

The full resolution path, from login to a single check (sources: `AuthContext.tsx` `login`/`hasPermission`, `utils/permissions.ts` `checkPermission`):

```
on login(credentials):
    token = POST /api/auth/login                       # unwrap { data: { access_token } }
    store token; set Authorization header

    eff   = GET /api/user/permission/platform          # EffectivePermissions
    count = GET /api-system/user?page=1&perpage=1      # read paginate.total

    hasAnyPermission = eff exists and (
        eff.is_super_admin
        or eff.platform is non-empty
        or eff.clusters has any key
    )
    isBootstrap = count is not null and count <= 1     # first-admin escape hatch

    if not hasAnyPermission and not isBootstrap:
        tear down the partial session (drop token, permissions, header)
        return "Access Denied. You are not authorized to access this platform."

    persist session; cache eff in localStorage["effectivePermissions"]


function hasPermission(key, opts?):                    # AuthContext — used by ALL gates
    # 1. Bootstrap escape hatch: 0-1 users => allow everything
    if userCount is not null and userCount <= 1:
        return true
    return checkPermission(effectivePermissions, key, opts)


function checkPermission(eff, key, opts?):             # pure function, utils/permissions.ts
    if eff is null:
        return false
    # 2. Super-admin bypass — checked before any key list
    if eff.is_super_admin:
        return true
    # 3. Platform-scoped grant applies everywhere
    if key in eff.platform:
        return true
    # 4a. Cluster-specific check: only that cluster's grants count
    if opts.clusterId is set:
        return key in eff.clusters[opts.clusterId]
    # 4b. Broad check (no clusterId): any cluster granting the key passes
    return any cluster_keys in eff.clusters where key in cluster_keys
```

The `EffectivePermissions` snapshot is fetched at login and again on every `AuthProvider` mount (page refresh), with the `localStorage` copy used as the initial value while the refetch is in flight. `userCount` is `null` until its fetch resolves; the bootstrap branch requires a non-null count, so during the loading window checks are enforced strictly.

## 5. Edge Cases

| # | Scenario | Behaviour | Tester notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bootstrap login — platform has 0 or 1 total users | `login()` admits a session with zero permissions; every `hasPermission` returns `true`, so all routes, sidebar entries, and `<Can>` blocks open | The intended first-admin path: sign in, create roles, assign them. Dormant as soon as a second user row exists; an in-flight session does not re-check the count until refresh/login |
| 2 | `userCount` still `null` (count fetch pending or failed) | Bootstrap branch does not fire; checks run strictly against the permission snapshot | A failed count fetch fails closed, not open |
| 3 | Super admin session | `is_super_admin` short-circuits before any key list — even with empty `platform`/`clusters` everything passes | Never QA key coverage from a super-admin session; it cannot reveal missing grants. Test with a role-built session instead |
| 4 | `user_platform.read` without `user_platform.manage` | List and detail pages load; the Roles & Scope card is read-only — Add Role, the add-role form, and Remove buttons do not render | The canonical `<Can>` test case; verify the buttons are absent, not merely disabled |
| 5 | `role.read` without `role.delete` | The Delete item in the Roles list dropdown is still visible and clickable — no client-side `.delete` gate exists | Expect the backend to reject and the SPA to surface an error toast; if the delete succeeds, that is a backend authorization gap, not intended behaviour |
| 6 | Permission revoked mid-session | The cached `effectivePermissions` snapshot keeps granting until the next login or `AuthProvider` mount refetches | Backend enforcement is the real boundary; the SPA snapshot is advisory between refreshes |
| 7 | New permission key needed | The catalog is read-only in the SPA — new `resource.action` rows arrive only via backend seed/migration and redeploy | A feature branch adding a guarded route must coordinate a backend catalog change; the key will not exist until then |
| 8 | Cluster-scoped role and platform-wide routes | Route guards check without `clusterId`, so any single cluster grant opens the corresponding screens globally | Scoping narrows `<Can clusterId>` call sites and backend data filtering, not SPA route access |
| 9 | Dev builds with an empty permission response | `DEV_MOCK_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSIONS` (all platform-management keys, `is_super_admin: false`) is substituted in `import.meta.env.DEV` only | Never active in production builds; do not interpret dev-mode access as a grant |
| 10 | Granting cluster access | `cluster.*` keys also open `/business-units*` — there are no separate `business_unit.*` keys | Include Business Units screens in any cluster-permission test plan |

## 6. Recommendations

- **Test per key, not per persona.** Build one QA role per permission key (or small key set) and verify the route, sidebar entry, and in-page affordances toggle together — they share one resolver, so a divergence indicates a hardcoded gate.
- **Keep a non-super-admin QA account.** Edge case 3 makes super-admin sessions useless for verifying grants; reserve the flag for testing the bypass itself and the `/platform/super-admins` screen.
- **Treat SPA gates as advisory.** Every mutation the SPA hides behind a key (`user_platform.manage`, the ungated role Delete) must be re-verified against the backend with a token lacking that key — client-side gating alone is not a security boundary.
- **When adding a guarded feature**, register all three layers together: the catalog row (backend), the `requiredPermission` on the route, and the sidebar `permission` field — plus `<Can>` for any action narrower than the route's key. Follow the `resource.action` naming of the existing catalog.
- **Decide deliberately about `business_unit.*`.** If Business Units ever needs independent gating, new keys plus route/sidebar updates are required; until then, document the `cluster.*` reuse in test plans rather than treating it as a bug.
