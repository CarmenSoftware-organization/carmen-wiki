# Carmen Inventory — Process Coverage Checklist

Internal tracker (not a published Wiki.js page). Enumerates every Carmen Inventory
process by module — sourced from `../carmen/docs/` — and records whether the wiki
documents it. Answers: "is the Inventory documentation project finished?".

How to read: each row is a sub-process. **BR/UF/TS** = covered in the module's
`02-business-rules` / `03-user-flow*` / `04-test-scenarios*` page(s).
Symbols: ✅ complete · 🟡 partial/stub · ⬜ missing. See "How status is judged".
