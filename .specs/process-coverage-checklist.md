# Carmen Inventory — Process Coverage Checklist

Internal tracker (not a published Wiki.js page). Enumerates every Carmen Inventory
process by module — sourced from `../carmen/docs/` — and records whether the wiki
documents it. Answers: "is the Inventory documentation project finished?".

How to read: each row is a sub-process. **BR/UF/TS** = covered in the module's
`02-business-rules` / `03-user-flow*` / `04-test-scenarios*` page(s).
Symbols: ✅ complete · 🟡 partial/stub · ⬜ missing. See "How status is judged".

### 6. Costing
Source: `../carmen/docs/costing/` · Wiki: `en/inventory/costing/`

> **Note:** Costing is an engine/concept module — it has no document lifecycle of its own. Every sub-process is triggered by an upstream inventory transaction post or a period-end run. BR coverage is via `02-business-rules.md` rule families `COST_VAL_*` / `COST_CALC_*` / `COST_AUTH_*` / `COST_POST_*` / `COST_XMOD_*`. UF coverage is across the three role-specific flow pages (Finance, Controller, Auditor). TS coverage is across `04-test-scenarios.md` (cross-persona) and the three role-specific scenario pages.

### 7. Inventory
Source: `../carmen/docs/inventory-management/`

> **Note:** Inventory is the stock-ledger / on-hand engine module — it has no document lifecycle of its own. Every sub-process is either a movement posted via an upstream source module (GRN, SR, adjustment, count, credit note) or a period-level lifecycle action. BR coverage is via `02-business-rules.md` rule families `INV_VAL_*` / `INV_CALC_*` / `INV_AUTH_*` / `INV_POST_*` / `INV_XMOD_*`. UF coverage is across the four role-specific flow pages (Store Keeper, Inventory Controller, Finance, Audit/Config) plus the overview `03-user-flow.md`. TS coverage is across `04-test-scenarios.md` (cross-persona scenarios) and the four role-specific scenario pages. Two non-`02-business-rules` reference pages exist: `transaction.md` (ledger view / edge-cases) and `period-end.md` (close ceremony).

### 8. Product
Source: `../carmen/docs/product-management/`

> **Note:** Product is master-data — there is no document `doc_status` workflow, no posting event, and no period lock. The sub-processes below cover the CRUD + lifecycle surface owned by the Product Administrator, plus the read-side lookup / scan surface owned by Purchaser and Store Keeper. BR coverage is via `02-business-rules.md` rule families `PRD_VAL_*` / `PRD_CALC_*` / `PRD_AUTH_*` / `PRD_LIFE_*` / `PRD_XMOD_*`. UF coverage is across `03-user-flow.md` (lifecycle + persona index) and the three role-specific flow pages. TS coverage is across `04-test-scenarios.md` (cross-persona scenarios) and the three role-specific scenario pages (`product-admin`, `purchaser`, `store-keeper`). One additional reference page exists: `category.md` (taxonomy CRUD, attribute inheritance, edge-case matrix).

### 10. Vendor Pricelist
Source: `../carmen/docs/vendor-pricelist-management/`

> **Note:** The module covers a 6-phase price-collection lifecycle — template setup, campaign/RFQ, vendor invitation, vendor portal submission, validation/quality scoring, and pricelist approval — plus downstream price-assignment on PR/PO and GRN variance checking. BR coverage is in `02-business-rules.md` (rule families `VPL_VAL_*` / `VPL_CALC_*` / `VPL_AUTH_*` / `VPL_POST_*` / `VPL_XMOD_*`, ~81 rules). UF is the `03-user-flow.md` lifecycle overview plus four per-persona files (Purchaser, Vendor, Finance, Audit/Config). TS is the `04-test-scenarios.md` cross-persona overview plus four per-persona scenario files — all with Pre-condition / Steps / Expected format. Vendor-master CRUD (Phase 1 in source) is referenced only obliquely in the wiki (VPL_XMOD_007, VPL_AUTH_002); no dedicated page or scenario exists for it.

### 11. Physical Count
Source: `../carmen/docs/app/inventory-management/physical-count/` , `../carmen/docs/app/inventory-management/physical-count-management/` , `../carmen/docs/documents/pc/`

> **Note:** The source has two parallel spec folders — `physical-count/` (simpler, single-wizard model) and `physical-count-management/` (richer lifecycle: 8 statuses, mobile-first counting UI, unit calculator, blind-count mode, notes/evidence sheet). The wiki documents the data-model-aligned version (three-tier: `tb_physical_count_period` → `tb_physical_count` → `tb_physical_count_detail`; 3 statuses per level). BR coverage is in `02-business-rules.md` (`PHC_VAL_*` / `PHC_CALC_*` / `PHC_AUTH_*` / `PHC_POST_*` / `PHC_XMOD_*`, ~28 rules + lifecycle discrepancy callouts). UF is the `03-user-flow.md` overview + three per-persona files (Count Lead, Counter, Audit/Config). TS overview (`04-test-scenarios.md`) has 20 cross-persona scenarios with Pre-condition + Expected, and per-persona files add ~30 scenarios each, but **none of the scenario tables include a Steps column** — the rubric requires Pre-condition/Steps/Expected for ✅; all TS cells are therefore 🟡.

### 12. Spot Check
Source: `../carmen/docs/inventory-management/period-end-process.md` (passing reference only — no dedicated SPC docs folder exists); rule authority is the wiki's own `02-business-rules.md` (`SPC_VAL_*` / `SPC_CALC_*` / `SPC_AUTH_*` / `SPC_POST_*` / `SPC_XMOD_*`, ~30 rules).

> **Note:** No carmen/docs source folder for spot-check exists; the BRD is captured via `tx-10-spot-check.md` (referenced in `02-business-rules.md` § 5.1). The wiki documents a flat two-tier tree (`tb_spot_check` → `tb_spot_check_detail`; no period parent). BR coverage is `02-business-rules.md` (~30 rules + 4 schema-vs-BRD discrepancy callouts). UF is the `03-user-flow.md` overview + three per-persona files (Inventory Controller, Counter, Audit / Config). TS covers `04-test-scenarios.md` (20 cross-persona rows) + three per-persona files (~78 scenarios total), but **none of the TS tables include a Steps column** — per the rubric, all TS cells are therefore 🟡. No E2E Playwright spec exists.
